Environment setup:

- Make sure to use python with a version >=3.6 in your linux or ubuntu platform.

-Execute the following commands:

$ sudo apt install python3-pip

(It's better to use tensorflow version 1 instead of tensorflow version 2)
$ pip install tensorflow==1.14 (or $ pip3 install tensorflow==1.14 )  
(If you use other version of tensorflow, first you need to uninstall that version by the command: $ pip uninstall tensorflow)

$ pip install open-cv python  (installing cv2 library which is needed for this application)

Application running steps:

Download the pre-trained models and data from links.txt file along with segmentation.py file from this repository. In the segmentation.py file change the data 
path "dir_data" and pretrained model path according to your local machine directory. Then run the segmentation.py file with below command:

python3 segmentation.py

This will generate a text file named "ResultFCN8.txt" with captured inference execution time.
For running the inference 30 times use runSegPred.sh script with below command:
./runSegPred.sh
