Download the pre-trained models and data from links.txt file along with segmentation.py file from this repository. In the segmentation.py file change the data 
path "dir_data" and pretrained model path according to your local machine directory. Then run the segmentation.py file with below command:

python3 segmentation.py

This will generate a text file named "ResultFCN8.txt" with captured inference execution time.
For running the inference 30 times use runSegPred.sh script with below command:
./runSegPred.sh
