#instructions for running the Acoustic Impedence estimation application

Environment Setup:

- Make sure to use python with a version >=3.6 in your linux or ubuntu platform.

-Execute the following commands:

$ sudo apt install python3-pip

(It's better to use tensorflow version 1 instead of tensorflow version 2)
$ pip install tensorflow==1.14 (or $ pip3 install tensorflow==1.14 )  
(If you use other version of tensorflow, first you need to uninstall that version by the command: $ pip uninstall tensorflow)

$ pip install open-cv python  (installing cv2 library which is needed for this application)


Application running steps:

Go to the links.txt file for original github repository. Download or clone the repository in your local machine. In the downloaded directory you will find
a file named train.py. To capture the inference execution time replace the train.py file of downloaded directory with this train.py file. 

Run the file with below command for training and testing:

python3 train.py

this is a default run with 1200 epochs.
if you want to run with fixed number of epochs then execute below command: 

python train.py --n_epochs 200
