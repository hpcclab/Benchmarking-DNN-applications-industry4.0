#Instructions for running the human activity recognition model
prerequesite: sklearn

Environment setup:

- Make sure to use python with a version >=3.6 in your linux or ubuntu platform.

-Execute the following commands:

$ sudo apt install python3-pip

(It's better to use tensorflow version 1 instead of tensorflow version 2)
$ pip install tensorflow==1.14 (or $ pip3 install tensorflow==1.14 )  
(If you use other version of tensorflow, first you need to uninstall that version by the command: $ pip uninstall tensorflow)

$ pip install open-cv python  (installing cv2 library which is needed for this application)

Application running steps:

Download all the files in a specific directory. After that run the python file UCI_ANN.py file with below command:
python3 UCI_ANN.py

This will generate a file named "ResultofUCIANN.txt" capturing the inference execution time once.

For running the inference 30 times use the bash script runUCI.sh as below command:
./runUCI.sh

This will generate a file named "ResultofUCIANN.txt" capturing the inference execution time for 30 times.
